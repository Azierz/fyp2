<h2>What is Cross-Site Scripting?</h2>
    <p>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy. Cross-site scripting carried out on websites accounted for roughly 84% of all security vulnerabilities documented by Symantec as of 2007.</p>
    <br><br><br>

<h2>How does XSS works?</h2>
    <p>When a user inputs malicious code into a web application, the code is executed by the web server and then sent to the user's browser. The malicious code is then executed by the user's browser. This can allow the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.</p>
    <br><br><br>

<h2>How to prevent XSS?</h2>
    <p>There are several ways to prevent XSS attacks. The most common way is to filter the input and output of data. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed characters, or by using a blacklist of disallowed characters. The blacklist approach is more common, as it is easier to implement and maintain. The blacklist approach is also more effective, as it prevents the attacker from using encoding to bypass the filter. For example, if the blacklist only disallows the characters < and >, then the attacker can use the encoded characters &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; to bypass the filter. However, if the blacklist disallows the characters <, >, and &, then the attacker cannot bypass the filter by encoding the characters.</p>

<h2>What is XSS Prevention?</h2>
    <p>XSS prevention is a technique used to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. XSS attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.</p>

XSS enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy. Cross-site scripting carried out on websites accounted for roughly 84% of all security vulnerabilities documented by Symantec as of 2007.</p>
    <br><br><br>
<h2>What is the Same-Origin Policy?</h2>
    <p>The same-origin policy is an important concept in the web application security model. Under the policy, a web browser permits scripts contained in a first web page to access data in a second web page, but only if both web pages have the same origin. An origin is defined as a combination of URI scheme, host name, and port number. For example, https://www.example.com:443 and https://www.example.com:8443 have different origins, as do https://www.example.com and http://www.example.com. The same-origin policy prevents a malicious script on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page through that page's Document Object Model (DOM). It is a critical security mechanism for isolating potentially malicious documents. The same-origin policy is enforced by web browsers.</p>
    <br><br><br>
<h2>What is DOM?</h2>
    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML, and XML documents. It provides a structured representation of the document as a tree. The DOM defines methods that allow access to the tree, so that they can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM provides a representation of the document as a structured group of nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.</p>
    <br><br><br>
<h2>What is the DOM XSS?</h2>
    <p>DOM-based cross-site scripting (DOM XSS) is a type of cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that occurs when user input is reflected back to the user in a way that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. DOM XSS is a type of XSS vulnerability that occurs when user input is reflected back to the user in a way that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.

<h2>What is the Stored XSS?</h2>
    <p>Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of cross-site scripting (XSS) attack that is stored on the server. Stored XSS attacks are a type of XSS attack that is stored on the server. Stored XSS attacks are a type of XSS attack that is stored on the server. Stored XSS attacks are a type of XSS attack that is stored on the server.</p>
